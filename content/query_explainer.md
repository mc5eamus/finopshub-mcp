I need to understand the purpose of a Kusto query in simple terms.
Here is some information about the Costs table model in Azure Data Explorer used by the query:
---
{finops_data_model}
---
Describe what the following Kusto query does in simple terms, so it focuses on its purpose and the essence of what it is supposed to deliver. Do not focus on how it is achieved and do not explain the underlying technology of Kusto. Avoid introductory phrases like 'this query does' or 'this query is used to', get directly to the matter in a way of 'Comparing the current and past month of consumption and identifying outliers.'.
